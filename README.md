# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Classification-Models
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in text. It can be categorized into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, among others. Classification models are commonly used for sentiment analysis. Here is an overview of how sentiment analysis can be performed using classification models:

Steps in Sentiment Analysis Using Classification Models
Data Collection:

Gather a large dataset of text labeled with sentiment. This data can come from social media posts, reviews, comments, etc.
Data Preprocessing:

Text Cleaning: Remove noise such as HTML tags, special characters, and punctuations.
Tokenization: Split text into individual words or tokens.
Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase to maintain uniformity.
Stop Words Removal: Remove common words like 'and', 'is', etc., which do not contribute to sentiment.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form.
Feature Extraction:

Bag of Words (BoW): Convert text into a matrix of token counts.
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF): Reflect the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.
Word Embeddings: Use pre-trained models like Word2Vec, GloVe, or contextual embeddings like BERT to represent words in continuous vector space.
Model Selection and Training:

Choose a classification model:
Logistic Regression: Simple and effective for binary classification problems.
Naive Bayes: Suitable for text data due to its probabilistic nature.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Effective for high-dimensional spaces.
Decision Trees and Random Forests: Handle non-linear relationships well.
Neural Networks: Including simple feedforward networks to more complex architectures like RNNs, LSTMs, or transformers.
Train the model on the processed and vectorized text data.
Model Evaluation:

Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the model on a test set.
Deployment:

Deploy the trained model to predict sentiment on new, unseen text data.
Use techniques like model saving and loading (e.g., with joblib or pickle in Python) and integration with web services or APIs.
